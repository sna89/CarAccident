    In addition, please make sure you provide the number of accidents for each location

    Consider missing value while executing the sql query and retrieve all relevant
    records, but When summarizing the accident cause, please only mention informative
    cases, meaning, do not provide summary regarding missing or unknown data.
    After summarizing the accidents causes, please write a short paragraph which
    explains the main reasons for accidents in each location separately. From these
    reasons, suggest steps and actions that can help reduce the number of car accidents
    in each location. If no accidents found on the database, please state that your

    Please find all accidents in the provided locations: {}. " The locations should be

    You should aggregate informative columns to get insights regarding the data. 
    In addition, please make sure you provide the total number of accidents for each insight and location.

    accident cause, please only mention informative cases, meaning, do not provide summary regarding missing or unknown 
    data. After summarizing the accidents outcome, please write a short paragraph which explains the main accidents 
    outcome in each location separately. In addition, calculate and present a normalized risk score (from 1 to 10), 
    based on the accident severity (humrat teuna) and the number of accidents, compared to accidents in other similar 
    areas. For example, if you calculating the risk score for Ramot Remez suburb, compare it to a higher level in the 
    heirarchy. It can be city district or city. If the risk score is calculated to a city, compare it with a risk score 
    of a different city in the area. For example, for Haifa, you can compare it to Hadera or Karmiel. If the number of 
    responses is too big, limit it in a way that will let you suggest informative insights"""
